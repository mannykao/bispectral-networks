This is a set of images from the Van Hateren database, curated by Bruno Olshausen and hosted at http://rctn.org/bruno/data/myvanhateren/. We use the original images from the images/ folder at the host website rather than the whitened ones found in IMAGES.mat.  

The citation for the original dataset is below:
